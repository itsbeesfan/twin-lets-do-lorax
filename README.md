# twinnn let's do lorax

--------
just a website to ask your twin they want to dress up as the lorax and the onceler with you. 

### what is this?
a silly, small, simple website to ask your friend if they want to dress up as the lorax and the onceler for halloween with you.
it's also a way to add 36 seconds to my hackatime hours for the Athena Award. 

### what does it contain?
- a main page where the important question is asked
- a page if you choose to dress up as the lorax and the onceler (with its respective beautiful image and a rethink button
in case you rethink your life choices)
- a page if you choose NOT to dress up as the lorax and the onceler (also with its respective beautiful image and a rethink
button in case you change your mind).

### why?
cause i need the 36s, and i thought it was funny, and also to send this to my twin.

### how it works:
1 html, 1 css, 1 js. js switches between the pages and makes the buttons work. not much more about it to be honest...

### challenges and learning opportunities:
- i did this entirely on my own. no google searches, no nothing. just my brain. this helped me reinforce my js and css skills. 
- it was challenging to find a high quality image of a lorax + onceler costume. 
- finally, i found it hard to link the image in github pages (i'd forgotten how to do it correctly, but i eventually worked it out)
yay

### extra info
do i get my 36s yet?
